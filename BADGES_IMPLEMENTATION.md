## Files Created

### Service Layer

- **`src/components/badges/BadgeGrid.tsx`** - Responsive grid (2-col mobile, 3-col md, 4-col lg+) with filtering, loading skeletons, empty states
- **`src/components/badges/StreakSummary.tsx`** - Streak module with ProgressRing, days count, skips remaining, CTA to learn more, telemetry
- **`src/components/badges/ChallengeList.tsx`** - Active challenges with steps progress, complete step buttons, due dates, completion handling
- **`src/components/badges/BadgeDetailsDrawer.tsx`** - Side drawer with full badge details, emblem, criteria, progress ring (in-progress), earned info, related action CTAs, focus trap, deep-link support

### Page
- **`src/app/rewards/badges/page.tsx`** - Full implementation with URL sync, local state, tab filtering, challenge completion, telemetry, all states (loading/error/empty/success)

## Files Modified

### MSW Handlers
- **`src/mocks/handlers.ts`** - Added:
  - Import of badgesSeed with in-memory state
  - `GET /api/rewards/badges` - Returns badges payload with current context
  - `POST /api/rewards/challenges/:id/step` - Increments stepsDone, marks related badge as earned when complete, returns update with badgeEarned flag

### Design System Index
- **`src/design-system/index.ts`** - Added exports for ProgressRing and StatusRibbon

## Key Features Implemented

### Badge System
- 3 status levels: earned (green), in-progress (blue), locked (gray)
- 4 badge kinds: milestone, streak, challenge, surprise
- Filtering by status with tab counts
- Progress tracking for in-progress badges (0-100%)
- Earned dates for completed badges
- Account context filtering (some badges Reserved-only)

### Gamification Elements
- **Streak Tracking**: Progress ring showing days toward next milestone, skips allowance/used, CTA to learn more
- **Challenges**: Multi-step quests with due dates, progress bars, step completion interaction
- **Badge Earning**: Completing final challenge step earns related badge, triggers success toast

### Interactions
- Click badge card to open details drawer
- Deep-link support: `/rewards/badges?badge=b-early` auto-opens drawer
- Tab filtering updates URL: `?view=earned`
- Complete challenge steps increments progress, earns badges
- Focus trap in drawer, Esc to close, returns focus to card
- Related action buttons route to /offers, /history, /tiers, /goals

### States
- Loading: Skeleton cards with `aria-busy="true"`
- Error: Banner with Retry button
- Empty: "Your first badge is just ahead" with links to /offers and /goals
- Success: Grid of badges with filtering

### State Management
- **Local state only** - No AppContext extension (follows principle of colocation for read-only motivational views)
- Uses React hooks: useState for badges/streak/challenges/loading/error/view/drawer
- Uses useSearchParams and useRouter for URL sync

## Accessibility (A11y)

- Page uses `<main>` with h1 "Badges"
- Tabs use `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"`, `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`
- Each tab has count badge (not just color)
- Progress indicators have text equivalents: `aria-label="60% complete"`, visible percentage text
- Emblems have `aria-label` describing the badge
- Drawer uses `role="dialog"`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`
- Focus trap in drawer, returns focus to originating card on close
- StatusRibbon uses text + color + icon (not color alone)
- Locked badges show lock icon overlay + "Locked" text
- ProgressRing has `role="img"` with descriptive label
- Keyboard: Tab through tabs → cards → challenges, Enter activates
- Hit targets >= 44px

## Responsive Design

- **Mobile (sm)**: Vertical stack (Streak → Tabs → Grid 2-col → Challenges), drawer full-screen
- **Tablet (md)**: Grid 3-col, drawer 480px side panel
- **Desktop (lg+)**: Grid 4-col

## Telemetry Events

All events logged to console:

- `badges_viewed` - { accountContext, counts: { all, earned, inProgress, locked } }
- `badge_opened` - { badgeId }
- `challenge_step_completed` - { challengeId, stepsDone, stepsTotal }
- `badge_earned` - { badgeId, kind }
- `streak_viewed` - { days, skipsLeft }

## Data Contract

### Badge
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  title: string;
  status: "earned" | "in_progress" | "locked";
  kind: "milestone" | "streak" | "challenge" | "surprise";
  criteria: string;
  progressPct?: number; // 0-100
  earnedAt?: string | null; // YYYY-MM-DD
  emblem: string; // emoji
  relatedActions: Array<{label: string; route: string}>;
  source?: string | null;
  accountContext: "overview" | "preferred" | "reserved";
}
```

### Streak
```typescript
{
  days: number;
  skipAllowance: number;
  skipsUsed: number;
  nextMilestone: number;
}
```

### Challenge
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  title: string;
  due: string; // YYYY-MM-DD
  stepsTotal: number;
  stepsDone: number;
  relatedBadgeId: string;
}
```

## MSW Handler Logic

### GET /api/rewards/badges
- Returns badges.json with current accountContext
- Includes in-memory state for challenges and badge status

### POST /api/rewards/challenges/:id/step
- Finds challenge by ID
- Increments stepsDone (clamped to stepsTotal)
- If stepsDone === stepsTotal:
  - Finds related badge by relatedBadgeId
  - Sets badge.status = 'earned'
  - Sets badge.earnedAt = today
  - Sets badge.progressPct = 100
  - Returns badgeEarned: true
- Returns { id, stepsDone, badgeEarned }

## Business Rules

- `progressPct` clamped 0-100
- `earnedAt` required when status === "earned"
- `skipsUsed <= skipAllowance` (validated in UI)
- `stepsDone <= stepsTotal`
- Completing final challenge step earns related badge immediately
- Deep-link `?badge=id` auto-opens drawer with focus on title
- Tab counts dynamically calculated from badge statuses
- Feature flags: `SHOW_STREAK`, `SHOW_CHALLENGES` (hardcoded true for now)

## Integration

- Uses existing AccountSelector component
- Uses existing design system components (Button, Card, Badge, Pill)
- Uses existing ToastHost for success/error messages
- Uses MSW setup with in-memory state
- Follows patterns from History screen (local state, URL sync)
- ProgressRing can be reused in TierProgressCard if refactoring desired

## Design System Enhancements

### ProgressRing Component
Extracted and generalized the SVG circular progress from TierProgressCard:
- Flexible sizing (default 192px)
- Customizable stroke width (default 8px)
- Customizable color (default green-600)
- Accepts children for center content
- Smooth 500ms transitions
- Proper ARIA labels

### StatusRibbon Component
New atom for badge status indication:
- Earned: green background, "Earned {date}"
- In Progress: blue background, "In Progress"
- Locked: gray background, "Locked" + lock icon
- Absolutely positioned (top-right by default)
- Text + color + icon for accessibility

## Testing Verification

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/rewards/badges to verify:
1. 12 badges load in grid (2-col mobile, 4-col desktop)
2. Tabs show counts: All (12), Earned (3), In Progress (4), Locked (5)
3. Click each tab to filter badges
4. Earned badges show green ribbon with date
5. In-progress badges show blue ribbon and progress bar
6. Locked badges show gray ribbon, lock icon, semi-transparent
7. Click badge card to open details drawer
8. Drawer shows emblem, title, status, criteria, progress (if in-progress), earned info (if earned), related action buttons
9. Focus trap in drawer, Esc to close
10. Test deep-link: /rewards/badges?badge=b-early auto-opens drawer
11. Streak module shows progress ring, days, skips remaining
12. Challenges section shows 2 challenges with progress
13. Click "Complete Step" on challenge → stepsDone increments
14. Complete final step → badge earned, success toast shown
15. Verify accessibility: keyboard nav, screen reader labels, progress text
16. Check telemetry events in console
17. Test responsive: mobile 2-col → desktop 4-col
