- ✅ Next tier emphasized with "Next" badge
- ✅ Responsive overflow handling

### Benefits Accordion
- ✅ Filters benefits to show only those available for current tier
- ✅ WAI-ARIA compliant: `button[aria-expanded]`, `role="region"`, `aria-labelledby`
- ✅ Keyboard navigation: Enter/Space toggles, Up/Down arrows move between items
- ✅ Mobile: single-open (strict) - opens one, auto-closes others
- ✅ Desktop: multi-open allowed
- ✅ Each benefit shows: title, summary, details (when expanded), limits, eligible tiers
- ✅ Empty state: "No special benefits at this tier yet—see ways to advance."

### Ways to Advance

## 🎨 Responsive Design

- **sm (mobile)**: Vertical stack, progress bar, 1-column suggestions, strict single-accordion
- **md+ (desktop)**: Two columns (left: progress + benefits; right: requirements + suggestions), progress ring, multi-open accordion

## ♿ Accessibility (A11y)

- ✅ Proper landmarks: `<main>` with page content
- ✅ Heading hierarchy: h1 for "Your Tier", h2 for sections (via CardTitle)
- ✅ Progress element uses `role="progressbar"` with `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax`, and text label
- ✅ Accordion follows WAI-ARIA: `button[aria-expanded]`, `role="region"`, `aria-labelledby`
- ✅ Keyboard navigation: accordion items support Enter/Space (toggle), Up/Down (navigate), roving tabindex
- ✅ Live region announces grace status when applicable (`aria-live="polite"`)
- ✅ All CTAs have clear labels and are ≥44px target size
- ✅ Focus-visible styles on all interactive elements
- ✅ Color contrast meets AA standards

## 📊 Telemetry Events

All events logged to console as specified:

- `tiers_viewed` - { tier, progressPct, inGrace: boolean }
- `benefit_opened` - { benefitId }
- `advance_suggestion_clicked` - { id, targetRoute }

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Systems

- ✅ Uses `AppContext` for global state
- ✅ Uses `AccountSelector` for context switching
- ✅ Reuses existing `TierChip` component (already supports grace display)
- ✅ Integrates with MSW for API mocking
- ✅ Uses design system components consistently
- ✅ Follows established patterns from Home, Rewards, and Offers screens

## 🧮 Business Rules Implemented

- ✅ `progressPct` clamped 0-100
- ✅ `deltaToNextUsd` displayed with proper formatting
- ✅ Benefits filtered: only shows where `tiers.includes(memberTier.tier)`
- ✅ Grace period shown only if `graceEndsAt >= today`
- ✅ Fallback computation: progress can be calculated from `aum` vs `nextTier.aumMin` if needed

## 🔗 Routing & Navigation

- ✅ Page accessible at `/tiers`
- ✅ Suggestions route to:
  - "Activate All Offers" → `/offers`
  - "Set up Direct Deposit" → `/goals`
  - "Grow Savings Balance" → `/goals`
- ✅ Grace "How grace works" link → `/support#grace`
- ✅ FAQ link → `/support#tiers-faq`
- ✅ Account context preserved on navigation

## 🎁 Reused Components

- **TierChip** (existing from Home) - displays tier badge with optional grace status
